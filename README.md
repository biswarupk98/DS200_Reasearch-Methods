# DS200_Reasearch-Methods

This notebook contains crime data analysis (citywise and statewise) in India during COVID-time (2021). This data taken from https://data.gov.in/. 
Summary:Line plot are used to express a relationship between two variables.Here we also see that largest number of people involved in IPC crime from the city Delhi,Chennai,Surat.The persons Discharged from case is zero in most of the cities.\\
The bar graph helps to compare the different sets of data among different groups easily. As seen from the bar plot, number of the people arrested(under IPC) in the Delhi city is highest city.Mumbai and Chennai are close to each other in the number of people arrested.The lowest number of people is arrested in Kozhikode (Kerala) .\\
It can be seen from above box plot that "High Crime Rate" category has a very large range. While the "Medium Crime Rate" and "Low Crime Rate" categories are scattered very close to the median.\\
We also see that the person chargesheeted is correlated with person convicted but uncorrelated with person arrested,person discharged. In the person discharged ,if we removed 2-3 outliers then it has strong correlation with person arrested,chargesheeted,convicted,otherwise it is uncorrelated. Also see that person acquitted is uncorrelated with every person . From this data we know that when there is large nubmer of people arrested,then there is higher probability of existence of people with chargesheeted .Also see that number of people discharged from the case (except 2-3 city)is linear proportional to the person arrested,chargesheeted,convicted.
